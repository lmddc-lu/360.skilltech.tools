360.skilltech.tool export
=========================

This archive contains all files needed for your virtual visit. You will need a web server to serve these files (even a basic one). One way to achieve that, if you already have Python installed, is to run from the command line:

    cd /path/to/360_visit
    python -m http.server

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000/v/tour.html
